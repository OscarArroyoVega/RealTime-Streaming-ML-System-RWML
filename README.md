### Summary
This is a real world practice to improve MLOPS and ML engigneering skills. 
The objective it to build a ML system for the crypto price prediction problem.
Even if i've writen 70% of the code in this repository (me and my LLM friend) to ensure I learn the topics, I must say that the original repostitory has been a guide in the 99% of the steps, it is here https://github.com/Real-World-ML/real-time-ml-system-cohort-2.
